      <Displayseven title='suggested project & deliverable' desc="A Million Comforts: This program aims to provide affordable pads to young women in Mukuru. The program seeks to eradicate period poverty by offering Affordable, Biodegradable and Super Absorbent Banana Fiber Sanitary towels. With utilization of Banana Pseudo stem, an agricultural waste for textile, Sauti Africa manufactures pads that are eight times more absorbent than any other pad in the market by using non-woven organic fiber and non-woven organic clothes to keep girls in villages and informal settlements in school and create jobs for local women.
 
Sauti Africa believes that as a social enterprise they can conduct business by keeping people, the planet and economic empowerment at the heart of everything they do. The program reduces plastic waste, offers employment for local women and additional income to banana farmers for their agricultural waste.
 
The organization is looking for a way to ensure that this program will be able to finance some of the activities that they are doing.
