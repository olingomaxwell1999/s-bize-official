      <Displayseven title='suggested project & deliverable' desc="

The suggested deliverable for this project is designing an impactful Youth Entrepreneurship programme for young people living in Mathare.

The Education program is not inclusive to the group that dropped out of school  before sitting for K.C.P.E (Kenya Certificate of Primary Education) and also those who got poor grades after Form 4. Youth in this group often become idle and easily start involving in harmful activities including drug abuse and insecurity (theft), this group of youths therefore become a  threat to the community and can be engaged in other activities for their survival. We believe that they can be  developed in entrepreneurship as a pathway to self-reliance.
